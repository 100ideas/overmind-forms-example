# overmind.js `overmind-forms-example` demo

for overmind v15.1.2 & react v16.8.1 using @garth's `overmind-forms` package

[codesandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/100ideas/overmind-forms-demo/tree/codesandbox_v1)

**Note:** you may need to use a patched version of `overmind-forms` - see below

`overmind-forms` documentation here: https://github.com/garth/overmind-forms

**Related/better**: https://github.com/garth/state-forms. I integrated some of the validation code from `state-forms` into the `src/overmind/login` form code for this demo. It would probably be better to just adapt state-forms to overmind since it looks like its used more broadly.
